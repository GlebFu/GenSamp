\section{Cluster Analysis}\label{cluster-analysis}

\subsection{Population Frame}\label{population-frame}

The population frame is composed of data from three sources: (1) the
Common Core of Data (CCD), (2) publically available accountability data,
and (3) the U.S. Census. The CCD is a comprehensive database housing
anually collected national statistics of all public schools and
districts. Accountability data was used to calculate the proportion of
students within each school performing at or above proficiency in Math
and ELA. Finally, local median income was obtained from the U.S. Census
and was matched to each school by zipcode. Weighted means of school
level variables were calculated using school size (number of students)
to generate district level covariates. In this sense, district
covariates describe the population of students rather than the
population of schools. These are reported in Table \ref{tab:tbl-desc}

\subsubsection{Covariates}\label{covariates}

Selection of covariates was driven by prior research on district and
school participation behavior in RCTs (Stuart et al., 2017; Tipton et
al., 2016a; Fellers, 2017). Districts and schools with higher
proportions of students who are English language learners (ELL),
economically disadvantaged (ED), non-White, and living in urban settings
are more likely to participate, as are larger districts and schools. It
is important to note, however, that some of these characteristics might
also make it more likely that researchers would recruit these districts
and schools in the first place. Anecdotal evidence from several research
teams also suggests that schools are less willing to participate in
experimental interventions for subjects in which their students are
already excelling, therefore math and ELA achievement covariates were
also included.

\subsubsection{Omitted Variable}\label{omitted-variable}

Neighborhood median income was selected to serve as the omitted variable
for several reasons. First, it is related to sevarl of the other
variables and therefore likely plays a role in the likelyhood of a
school participating. Second, because it comes from a non-educational
data source (the census) and requires additional work to include in the
population frame it is likely to be omitted in practice.

\caption{\label{fig:dists2}Distributions of the remaining covariates.}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Variable Transformations}\label{variable-transformations}

Log-transformation was used on school size (number of students) and
median income. This is done to allow proportional comparisons at the
extremes of the distributions (Hennig and Liao - 2013). For instance,
the difference between two schools with 4000 and 3000 students should be
weighed as much as the difference between two schools with 400 and 300
students when generating clusters. Figure \ref{fig:dists} displays a
comparison of the distribution of these variables and hteir logs. Figure
\ref{fig:dists2} displays the distribution of the remaining variables.
\ref{tab:tbl-desc}

\subsection{SUBS}\label{subs}

Stratification using balanced sampling (SUBS) was performed prior to
simulation because the group of schools in each strata would be static
across conditions except where the balancing model is manipulated. The
set of covariates in both the full model (SUBS-F) and the omitted
variable model (SUBS-OV) include binary indicator variables

\subsubsection{Number of Clusters}\label{number-of-clusters}

Selecting the number of clusters, \(k\), is one of the most difficult
problems in cluster analysis (Steinley, 2006). To date, the most
extensive investigation of methods for determining \(k\) was conducted
by Milligan and Cooper (1985) who analyzed 30 methods. However, aside
from the limited generalizability of this study, many methods are also
innapropriate in the context of non-hierarchical and thus do not support
k-means clustering. Hennig and Liao (2013) argue that the method of
selecting \(k\) should depend on the context of the clustering and frame
the issue as one of obtaining an appropriate subject-matter-dependent
definition of rather than a statistical estimation.
