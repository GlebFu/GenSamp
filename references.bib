  abstract = {As a result of the use of random assignment to treatment, randomized experiments typically have high internal validity. However, units are very rarely randomly selected from a well-defined population of interest into an experiment; this results in low external validity. Under nonrandom sampling, this means that the estimate of the sample average treatment effect calculated in the experiment can be a biased estimate of the population average treatment effect. This article explores the use of the propensity score subclassification estimator as a means for improving generalizations from experiments. It first lays out the assumptions necessary for generalizations, then investigates the amount of bias reduction and average variance inflation that is likely when compared to a conventional estimator. It concludes with a discussion of issues that arise when the population of interest is not well represented by the experiment, and an example.},

  abstract = {Background:An important question in the design of experiments is how to ensure that the findings from the experiment are generalizable to a larger population. This concern with generalizability is particularly important when treatment effects are heterogeneous and when selecting units into the experiment using random sampling is not possible?two conditions commonly met in large-scale educational experiments.Method:This article introduces a model-based balanced-sampling framework for improving generalizations, with a focus on developing methods that are robust to model misspecification. Additionally, the article provides a new method for sample selection within this framework: First units in an inference population are divided into relatively homogenous strata using cluster analysis, and then the sample is selected using distance rankings.Result:In order to demonstrate and evaluate the method, a reanalysis of a completed experiment is conducted. This example compares samples selected using the new method with the actual sample used in the experiment. Results indicate that even under high nonresponse, balance is better on most covariates and that fewer coverage errors result.Conclusion:The article concludes with a discussion of additional benefits and limitations of the method.},

Such causal relationships are of great importance in human affairs.

This book has two major purposes: to describe ways in which testing causal propositions can be improved in specific research projects, and to describe ways to improve generalizations about causal propositions.

  abstract = {Evaluations of the impact of social programs are often carried out in multiple sites, such as school districts, housing authorities, local TANF offices, or One-Stop Career Centers. Most evaluations select sites purposively following a process that is nonrandom. Unfortunately, purposive site selection can produce a sample of sites that is not representative of the population of interest for the program. In this paper, we propose a conceptual model of purposive site selection. We begin with the proposition that a purposive sample of sites can usefully be conceptualized as a random sample of sites from some well-defined population, for which the sampling probabilities are unknown and vary across sites. This proposition allows us to derive a formal, yet intuitive, mathematical expression for the bias in the pooled impact estimate when sites are selected purposively. This formula helps us to better understand the consequences of selecting sites purposively, and the factors that contribute to the bias. Additional research is needed to obtain evidence on how large the bias tends to be in actual studies that select sites purposively, and to develop methods to increase the external validity of these studies. \textcopyright{} 2012 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.},

In this article, we provide a generalizability index that can be used to assess the degree of similarity between the sample of units in an experiment and one or more inference populations on a set of selected covariates. The index takes values between 0 and 1 and indicates both when a sample is like a miniature of the population and how well reweighting methods may perform when differences exist.
