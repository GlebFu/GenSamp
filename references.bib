  abstract = {As a result of the use of random assignment to treatment, randomized experiments typically have high internal validity. However, units are very rarely randomly selected from a well-defined population of interest into an experiment; this results in low external validity. Under nonrandom sampling, this means that the estimate of the sample average treatment effect calculated in the experiment can be a biased estimate of the population average treatment effect. This article explores the use of the propensity score subclassification estimator as a means for improving generalizations from experiments. It first lays out the assumptions necessary for generalizations, then investigates the amount of bias reduction and average variance inflation that is likely when compared to a conventional estimator. It concludes with a discussion of issues that arise when the population of interest is not well represented by the experiment, and an example.},

  abstract = {Background:An important question in the design of experiments is how to ensure that the findings from the experiment are generalizable to a larger population. This concern with generalizability is particularly important when treatment effects are heterogeneous and when selecting units into the experiment using random sampling is not possible?two conditions commonly met in large-scale educational experiments.Method:This article introduces a model-based balanced-sampling framework for improving generalizations, with a focus on developing methods that are robust to model misspecification. Additionally, the article provides a new method for sample selection within this framework: First units in an inference population are divided into relatively homogenous strata using cluster analysis, and then the sample is selected using distance rankings.Result:In order to demonstrate and evaluate the method, a reanalysis of a completed experiment is conducted. This example compares samples selected using the new method with the actual sample used in the experiment. Results indicate that even under high nonresponse, balance is better on most covariates and that fewer coverage errors result.Conclusion:The article concludes with a discussion of additional benefits and limitations of the method.},
